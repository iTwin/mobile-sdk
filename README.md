## About this Repository

This repository contains the Swift code used to build [iTwin.js](http://www.itwinjs.org) applications on iOS devices.

__Note:__ You will get two warnings relating to `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` when you build any project that includes this as a Swift Package. Unfortunately, there is no way that I know of to disable those warnings. They can be ignored, though.
